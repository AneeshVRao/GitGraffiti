# Assets Folder

## Adding Your Screenshot

1. **Take a screenshot** of your GitHub profile contribution graph
   - Go to: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME`
   - Scroll to the contribution graph section
   - Take a screenshot (Windows: Win + Shift + S)

2. **Save the screenshot** as `contribution-graph.png` in this folder

3. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add assets/contribution-graph.png
   git commit -m " Add contribution graph showcase"
   git push
   ```

Your beautiful contribution art will then appear in the README!

## Tips for Best Screenshots

- Include the full contribution graph (all 52 weeks)
- Make sure your pattern is clearly visible
- Use light or dark theme based on preference
- Crop out unnecessary parts of the page
